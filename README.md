# Alpha College Website
Welcome to our college's website, which is totally designed and maintained by college members. Alpha College website is one of our major platforms for showing Alpha, consisting of several main sections.
- "Home": We can show the latest updating, some useful tools and amazing games.
- "Journal": It records our regular academy meetings, witnessing the birth of various activity schedules.
- "Activity": We document significant college activities from various sports competitions to the come-of-age ceremony.
- "Blog": It showcases our lively and fulfilling daily lives, including birthday parties, late-night snacks, and other small events. And the Picture Repository stores numerous memorable moments.
- "About": Introduce ourselves, like members, our preferences, and our culture.
  
Currently, the website has not been hosted on the school's servers yet. As a consequence, the website can only be visited via my personal GitHub page. We welcome everyone to construct our website, whether it's redesigning the layout and color scheme or writing content for academy activities and daily life. Of course, if you are passionate about web programming, you can even rewrite a specific page or the entire website supported by the backend.

 Wish our website a promising and sustainable development!
