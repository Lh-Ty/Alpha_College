Welcome to my website! This website serves as a platform to showcase my recent activities and experiences. The website is designed with a user-friendly interface to enhance your browsing experience.

Currently, the website is in its initial phase, and there are several areas that require improvement. Here is a list of the improvements that are needed:

1. Updating images and content: We need to update the website with images and content from the end of last semester and the beginning of this semester.

2. English/Chinese language switch: We are working on implementing a feature that allows the website to switch between English and Chinese.

3. Subpage layout and structure: We are still working on designing the layout and structure of the subpages to ensure the website is easy to navigate.

4. Image thumbnails: We are working on designing image thumbnails to help increase the loading speed of the website.

5. Meeting minutes link: We are in the process of changing the meeting minutes link to a webpage.

We appreciate your patience while we work to improve the website. Please check back soon for updates.
